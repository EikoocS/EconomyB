# EconomyB: A Modern, Modular Economy Plugin

> âš  **Warning**
> EconomyB is in the early stages of development. It is currently **unstable** and **not guaranteed to function correctly**. Use it **only** for **ontological debugging** and experimentation.

---

## What is EconomyB?

**EconomyB** is a modern, modular economy plugin designed with the following in mind:

* Support for multiple coexisting economies
* Asynchronous and responsive architecture
* Database-driven persistence

---

## Key Features

* âœ… Multi-economy support
* âœ… Asynchronous design
* âœ… Transaction system
* âœ… Database storage integration

---

## Installation Guide

The plugin is composed of three distinct modules:

* **`economyb`**
  The core module. Implements database connectivity and business logic. *Note: This module does not provide user-facing commands or APIs.*

* **`economyb-api`**
  The intermediate API layer. Provides an abstract interface (similar to VaultAPI), designed for use by other plugins. Also includes basic generic command support.

* **`economyb-api2vault`**
  A bridge module that maps `economyb-api` to VaultAPI, allowing Vault-compatible plugins (e.g., shops) to interact seamlessly with EconomyB.

> ðŸ’¡ **Recommendation**
> Install **all three modules** unless you explicitly do not require VaultAPI compatibility.

To install, simply place the JAR files into your serverâ€™s `plugins/` directory.
